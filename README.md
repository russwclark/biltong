A repository for sharing biltong recipes &amp; drying box designs

Biltong is dried or cured meat that originated in South Africa.  Biltong is often compared to jerkey, but the preparation process and resulting flavour is different and Biltong is usually air dried and not smoked.  The most commonly used meat is beef but, like jerky, biltong can be made from different kinds of meat and a variety of spices to produce a wide variety of biltong.  

Typically the key ingredients for basic biltong are;
1. Beef cut into strips betweeen 1/2 & 1 inch thick, typically cut with the grain.
2. Vinegar
3. Salt
4. Pepper
5. Corriander Seeds - This spice is primaraily responsible for the unique flavour of biltong. 

Commercial drying cabinets are available from a variety of suppliers but home made ones are relatively easy and enjoyable to make and can range from a simple carboard box to some fairly elaborate constructions.

I started making my own biltong about 10 years ago and in that time have tried a variety of meats, spice recipes and built at least 4 drying boxes, my first was actually a cardboard box!

I would recommend that you start small, especially with the amount of biltong that you actually prepare in your first few attempts.  It is quite common to make mistakes in the beginning and the last thing you want is to prepare a large batch of biltong only to discover that it is far too salty to eat and then throwing it all in the trash!

Biltong is delicious, and i hope this helps you to get started or even just provides you with some new ideas or spice combinations to try.  Either way, please submit your comments, your own recipes and box deisgns to help others discover and enjoy a wide variety of biltong!
