This is my go to recipe for making biltong.  I usually prepare a large batch of this spice combination and store it in a sealed container making it easy to prepare a quick batch.  As these spices are all dry, it will keep for many months.  The spice ratios are important, but you can multiply consistently to make a larger batch.

2 cups corriander seeds
1 cup soarse sea salt
1/2 cup brown sugar - i use cane sugar and the stickier the better
1/4 cup ground black pepper
1 tbl spoon Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate)

Spice preparation:
The only preparation required for this basic recipe is to VERY lightly crush the corriander seeds to release the flavour.  Put about 1 cup of the corriander seeds into the food processor with a blade attachment.  Pulse for 1 second then stop, repeating 3 or 4 times.  You are looking to just crack open the seeds, and definitely NOT produce a powder.
Mix all the dry ingredients together and store in a sealed plastic container.  Shake the container well to thoroughly mix the spices.
