This is my go to recipe for making biltong.  I usually prepare a large batch of this spice combination and store it in a sealed container making it easy to prepare a quick batch.  As these spices are all dry, it will keep for many months.  The spice ratios are important, but you can multiply consistently to make a larger batch.

2 cups corriander seeds
